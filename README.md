# Coursework on Kotlin
As a term paper, a program was written in Kotlin (works in the console), which emulates the work of a distribution center.
Distribution center - part of the logistics system, warehouse and distribution complex. Trucks filled with different types of goods from suppliers arrive at the ports of unloading. Trucks are unloaded, goods from the trucks are moved to the warehouse. The goods are removed from the warehouse and loaded onto trucks located at the loading ports, which are then sent to the points of sale. The center works asynchronously, coroutines are used.

# Install
You have to copy the files to your computer and open with IntelliJ IDEA and run the project.

# Usage
You just need to run the program. The program will randomly select the initial conditions and start working. After the removal of all goods from the warehouse, the program will automatically end.
